# Visualizations of the Deaths at the Borders Project

The Deaths at the Borders [Database](http://www.borderdeaths.org/?page_id=425) is an ‘evidence-base’ derived from official sources generated by the death management systems of Spain, Gibraltar, Italy, Malta and Greece. It aims to fill some of the gaps, and serve as a new, complementary resource to enable further analysis and research, and ultimately to move the discussions about border deaths forward towards concrete recommendations and policy changes.

We used the database to create unit and aggregated visualizations of different stories.

## Dataset metadata

* **Location** (the country, region and (primary) town from which the data was retrieved)
* **Year** (we used the following dates to assign a year to each case (in order of preference): date of death, date found, date of autopsy, date of inquiry, date of registration)
* **Case number** (we have assigned individual numbers to each case that refer to the country, the registry where the data was collected, and the number of the case)
* **Procedural information**, including: the date and place of registration, the date of inquiry/investigation into the death and the official body responsible for that inquiry/investigation, the date and institute of the forensic medical examination, whether the person was identified or not, known details about the identification, date of burial/burial authorization/repatriation of the body and final place of burial
* **Information about the person**, including: the label used to describe the (usually unidentified) cadaver in official documents, sex, age (as stated or calculated from date of birth), estimated age (usually based on the medical examination), stated country of nationality, country of birth, country of last residence, presumed ethnicity/race (as described in the documents), personal items found with the body, and noted features of the person
* **Information about the death**, including: date and place of death (as recorded in the documents; this may refer to the place the death was officially declared such as the port, or it may refer to the jurisdiction or to a specific place where the body was found), date and place the body was found (as recorded in the documents), circumstances in which the body was found, and how long the person was estimated to be dead before the body was found/examined
* **Information about the incident**, including: the place and assigned number of the incident (a shipwreck or crossing involving more than one death, that we found), and details of the incident (as recorded in the documents)
* **Cause of death**, including: primary cause of death, secondary cause of death, and other information regarding the cause of death or condition of the body
* **Source(s)** used in completing the data for that person (death certificates were the primary source of data for the Database), but in some places these were not available or not sufficient and so other archives were searched such as coroners archives and cemetery registers)
* **Certainty rating** (each case is classified as either 1-confirmed, 2-likely, or 3-possible, according to specific criteria
